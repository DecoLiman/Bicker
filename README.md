# Bicker

Part e-mail, part forum, part bulletin board, part chat, part blog with comments...

There's more information in [this blog post](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/programming/2020/01/06/bicker.html), but the short history is that I created the original version of *Bicker* a little more than ten years ago as shrinkwrapped software for offices.  I sold a few copies, but the company wasn't sustainable as I structured it and Ruby libraries had a flood of big security vulnerabilities, so I put that all aside to get a day job.

Today, I still see the need for a communications platform that encourages well-behaved conversations, so this is (will be) a modern re-implementation of *Bicker*, taking the same premise---communications where replies can only be inserted at punctuation marks and there is no "general" reply to something---and making it a completely-open project that can take advantage of more recent developments in the area.
