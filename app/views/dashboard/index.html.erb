	    Welcome to <b>Bicker</b>!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Bicker</b> is an attempt to change communications
	    for the better by building on the lessons of the past.
	    Among other things, you can think of it as&hellip;
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        Part e-mail,
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part forum,
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part bulletin board,
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part chat,
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part blog,
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part comment thread, and
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Part document management system.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    &hellip;<i>but</i>, unlike most of those other systems,
	    it&rsquo;s intentionally designed to encourage better
	    behavior in conversations.  A reply with a list of answers
	    with no context should be a thing of the past.  Replying
	    to the wrong person should be a thing of the past.
	    Arguments over who said what should be a thing of the past.
	    Multiple respondants saying exactly the same thing should
	    <i>absolutely</i> be a thing of the past.  That&rsquo;s
	    the past.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Bicker</b> is the future.  Well, it&rsquo;s actually
	    just one potential future of many, but that&rsquo;s not
	    nearly as pithy.
